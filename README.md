# Parkinson Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms based on spiral test data. The goal is to provide an accessible diagnostic solution, especially for people in remote areas with inadequate healthcare access.

## 🧠 Overview

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder affecting movement. Symptoms typically begin with tremors and may progress to stiffness and slowing of movement. Diagnosis in early stages can be challenging due to mild or unnoticed symptoms.

This project utilizes supervised machine learning models to analyze patient data and classify the presence of Parkinson's disease.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Implement machine learning models for Parkinson's disease detection.
- Use spiral test data from patients as input features.
- Analyze and compare performance of different classifiers.
- Explore potential for remote diagnosis in under-served areas.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
- The dataset includes features extracted from spiral drawing tests performed by patients.

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

These models were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in detecting Parkinson's disease based on input features.

## 📈 Future Work

- Use of actual handwriting features to enhance detection accuracy.
- Exploration of more complex neural network architectures.
- Development of a mobile or web-based diagnostic tool.
- Integrate other sensor data (e.g., pressure, pen tilt) to improve prediction robustness.

## 🏥 Significance

This project supports the development of noninvasive, low-cost decision support tools for healthcare professionals, especially valuable in rural and under-equipped regions.
